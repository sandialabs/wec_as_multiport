	abstract = {{The open-source WecOptTool was developed to make wave energy converter (WEC) control co-design accessible. WecOptTool is based on the pseudo-spectral method which is capable of efficiently dealing with any linear or nonlinear constraints and nonlinear dynamics by solving the WEC optimal control problem in the time domain using a gradient based optimization algorithm. This work1 presents a control co-optimization study of the AquaHarmonics Inc. heaving point absorber WEC sized for ocean deployment to solve practical industry design problems. Components such as the specific type of generator, the hull shape, and the displaced volume are pre-determined. We co-optimize the WEC's mass versus mooring line pretension in conjunction with the controller. The optimization is subject to the power-take-off (PTO) dynamics and the rated constraints of the components. In particular, the continuous torque rating is implemented as an explicit constraint, a novel approach for WEC optimization. The PTO dynamics are incorporated into the optimization algorithm via a combination of first principle methods (linear drivetrain model) and empirical efficiency maps (electrical generator) represented as a power loss map. This is a practical method applicable to a variety of PTO architectures and transferable to other WECs. A discussion between using an efficiency coefficient versus a power loss map and their implication for the optimization method is presented. This application of WecOptTool represents a real world WEC by combining simplified models with empirical efficiency data. The WEC, as a dynamically coupled, oscillatory system, requires consideration of the time trajectory dependent power loss for optimizing the average electrical power. This objective function, the modelling approach, and the realistic loss terms makes the common practice of artificially penalizing the reactive power needless.}},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the general problem of matching an arbitrary load impedance to a pure resistance by means of a reactive network. It consists primarily of a systematic study of the origin and nature of the theoretical limitations on the tolerance and bandwidth of match and of their dependence on the characteristics of the given load impedance. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the physical realizability of a function of frequency representing the input reflection coefficient of a matching network terminated in a prescribed load impedance. These conditions of physical realizability are then transformed into a set of integral relations involving the logarithm of the magnitude of the reflection coefficient. Such relations are particularly suitable for the study of the limitations on the bandwidth and tolerance of match. Definite expressions for these quantities are obtained in special cases. The practical problem of approaching the optimum theoretical tolerance by means of a network with a finite number of elements is also considered. Design curves are provided for a particularly simple but very important type of load impedance. In addition, a very convenient method is presented for computing the values of the elements of the resulting matching network.},

	abstract = {Actuator saturation is a common nonlinearity. In wave energy conversion, force saturation conveniently limits drivetrain size and cost with minimal impact on energy generation. However, such nonlinear dynamics typically demand numerical simulation, which increases computational cost and diminishes intuition. This paper instead uses describing functions to approximate a force saturation nonlinearity as a linear impedance mismatch. In the frequency domain, the impact of controller impedance mismatch (such as force limit, finite bandwidth, or parameter error) on electrical power production is shown analytically and graphically for a generic nondimensionalized single degree of freedom wave energy converter in regular waves. Results are visualized with Smith charts. Notably, systems with a specific ratio of reactive to real mechanical impedance are least sensitive to force limits, a criteria which conflicts with resonance and bandwidth considerations. The describing function method shows promise to enable future studies such as large-scale design optimization and co-design.},

	abstract = {The design space for ocean wave energy converters is notable for its divergence. To facilitate convergence, and thereby support commercialization, we present a new simple method for analysis and comparison of alternative device architectures at an early stage of the design process. Using Th{\'e}venin's theorem, Falnes crafted an ingenious solution for the monochromatic optimal power capture of heaving point absorber devices by forming a mechanical impedance matching problem between the device and the power take-off. However, his solutions are limited by device architecture complexity. In this paper, we use the mechanical circuit framework to extend Falnes' method to form and solve the impedance matching problem and calculate the optimal power capture for converter architectures of arbitrary complexity. The new technique is first applied to reprove Falnes' findings and then to assess a complex converter architecture, proposed by Korde. This work also provides insight into a master-slave relationship between the geometry and power take-off force control problems that are inherent to converter design, and it reveals a hierarchy of distinct design objectives unbeknownst to Korde for his device. Finally, we show how application of the master-slave principle leads to the reduction in the dimensionality of the associated design space.},

	abstract = {Results from laboratory experiments on a pre-tensioned heaving buoy of 8.4m diameter, tested at scale 1:16 is presented. The wave energy converter, which is under development by the Swedish company CorPower Ocean, is designed with a passive pneumatic machinery component referred to as WaveSpring, invented at NTNU. The negative spring arrangement inherently provides phase control. The power take off system and the effect of the phase-enhancement component was represented by a motor rig run with a force-feedback controller. Responses with and without the WaveSpring unit were measured in order to compare performance in terms of motions, loads and power absorption. The experiments included decay tests, radiation tests, irregular wave tests with the system in normal operation, as well as extreme wave tests with the system in survival mode. The power was extracted through a linear damping force, where the damping coefficients were set close to their theoretical optimum for the heave mode. The results show that with the WaveSpring component, the system is able to absorb three times more power in realistic sea conditions than without it. This is achieved without increasing the damping force, thus giving a three times higher ratio of absorbed energy to PTO force. The maximum mooring line tension in storm conditions is found to be less than 2.5 times the pretension force.},

	abstract = {The potential for control design to dramatically improve the economic viability of wave energy has generated a great deal of interest and excitement. However, for a number of reasons, the promised benefits from better control designs have yet to be widely realized by wave energy devices and wave energy remains a relatively nascent technology. This brief paper summarizes a simple, yet powerful approach to wave energy dynamics modeling, and subsequent control design based on impedance matching. Our approach leverages the same concepts that are exploited by a simple FM radio to achieve a feedback controller for wave energy devices that approaches optimal power absorption. If fully utilized, this approach can deliver immediate and consequential reductions to the cost of wave energy. Additionally, this approach provides the necessary framework for control co-design of a wave energy converter, in which an understanding of the control logic allows for synchronous design of the device control system and hardware.},

@article{Bacelli:2021aa,
	abstract = {The main objective of this letter is to consolidate the knowledge about the dynamics and control of oscillating-body wave energy converters (WECs). A number of studies have shown that control systems strongly affect power absorption; however, there remains a need for a concise and integrated explanation of the theoretical and practical implications that control can have on both performance and the broader WEC design process. This short letter attempts to fill this gap by presenting a discussion on the key practical aspects concerning the dynamics and control of oscillating-body WEC. In particular, the focus is on the choice of control models and a simple causal control scheme suitable for real-time implementation. Finally, consideration is given to the effect of the power takeoff (PTO) on the maximization of electrical power, thus leading to the derivation of useful conditions for the control co-design of the PTO system.},
