\begin{abstract}
As with other oscillatory power conversion systems, wave energy converter design can be understood as an impedance matching problem.
By representing the wave energy converter as a multi-port network, two separate, but related, impedance matching conditions can be established.
Satisfying these conditions maximizes power transfer to the load.
In practice, we may use these impedance matching conditions to influence system (hull, power take-off, controller, mooring, etc.) design.
To this end, this paper considers some example wave energy converter design applications with the help of the impedance matching conditions.

Wave energy converters (WECs) must be designed to capture a purely oscillatory power input.
Amongst other energy generation technologies (e.g., wind turbines, hydro-electric dams, nuclear power plants), this is a unique characteristic.
However, given the broad application of AC electrical power, there are useful tools at the disposal of a WEC designer for maximizing useful power output.

The concept of impedance matching to minimize reflections has been applied in wave energy since at least \rc{XX-find first reference}.
For reasons that are unclear, the concept was mostly only applied to the conversion stage for transferring power from the waves to the WEC's hull/input of the power take-off (PTO) system.
As will be discussed in further detail in this paper, disregarding the subsequent power conversion stages between mechanical power on the hull and useful (e.g., electrical) power at the output of the machine has a number of adverse repercussions.

This concept of transferring power between different stages is illustrated in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_power_transfer_stages}.
The ultimate goal of a WEC is to deliver power to a load.
In a WEC designed to produce electrical power, this would represent the electrical outputs from a motor/generator.
Because the source power is purely oscillatory, the power flow between the stages in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_power_transfer_stages} is shown to be bi-directional in general.
In fact, the optimal condition requires that half the power be reflected \rc{XX-cite}.
The conditions that ensure this optimal power transmission by minimizing reflections are shown at the top of \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_power_transfer_stages}.
The first impedance matching condition in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_power_transfer_stages} ($Z_{\textrm{in}} = Z_i^*$) is generally well-known and widely applied, although using somewhat different notation as the input/output distinction within the PTO is not widely utilized.
The second impedance matching condition in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_power_transfer_stages} ($Z_{\textrm{out}} = Z_\ell^*$) is mostly ignored and/or lumped with first condition, thus limiting performance.

\begin{figure}[tb]

\end{figure}

Power delivered to the load is affected by both losses and reflections in this system.
These two effects are distinct and must addressed with an appreciation as such.
Losses are due to friction or electrical resistance -- this effect is often more intuitive and will not be discussed here in detail.
Reflections are due to a mismatch in the system impedances.
%%% Dom feels this is a bit of an over-simplification maybe better suited for a discussion section later on. While minimizing losses is important, friction and resistance are contributors to the real part of impedance and, especially in absence of other contributors (gear ratio, Kt) being called out explicitly I think this might yield confusion.
This paper will further explore concepts of bi-conjugate impedance matching in wave energy previously raised by \cite{Bacelli:2021aa}, with the goal of generating a more practical understanding for the utility and application of this theory.
First, an basic review of network modeling and elements is presented (Section~\ref{sec:two_port_networks}).
Next, this framework is applied to a WEC and used to formulate the bi-conjugate impedance matching condition (Section~\ref{sec:modeling_a_direct_drive_wec}).
This framework is then applied in a number of illustrative case-studies (Section~\ref{sec:illustrative_examples}).

% % ------------------------------------------------------------------
% \section{Bi-conjugate impedance matching}\label{sec:bi_conjugate_impedance_matching}
% We may express the dynamics of a WEC using an intrinsic impedance ($Z_i$) that relates the velocity ($v$) to the external forces: an ``excitation'' force from incoming waves ($F_{\textrm{exc}}$) and a force from the PTO ($F_{\textrm{pto}}$) \cite{Falnes:2002aa}.

% \begin{equation}
%         Z_i v = F_{\textrm{exc}} - F_{\textrm{pto}}
%         \label{eq:intrinsic_impedance_eom}
% \end{equation}

% \noindent{}The intrinsic impedance can be defined by elements of the linear potential flow free surface hydrodynamics (see, e.g., \cite{Newman:1978aa}).

% \begin{equation}
%         Z_i(\omega) = B(\omega) + b_f + j \left( \omega{}(m + A(\omega)) - \frac{K_{h}}{\omega}\right)
% \end{equation}

% \noindent{}Here, $A(\omega)$ is the added mass, $B(\omega)$ is the radiation damping, $K_h$ is the hydrostatic stiffness, $b_f$ accounts for linear friction effects, and $m$ is the rigid body inertia.
% The imaginary unit is $j$ and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

% Much has been written about \eqref{eq:intrinsic_impedance_eom} and how to design a controller for $F_{\textrm{pto}}$ such that \emph{mechanical power} is maximized (see, e.g., \cite{Coe2020a} \rc{XX-cite others}).
% Within this approach to maximize mechanical power, there is an implicit assumption that the dynamics of the PTO can be decoupled from the hydrodynamic problem and, consequently, such a design will also maximize \emph{useful power} at the load (refer back to \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_power_transfer_stages}).

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Two-port networks}\label{sec:two_port_networks}
To consider the complete problem, without the faulty assumption that PTO dynamics may be decoupled from the hydrodynamic system, it is expedient to utilize the two-port network model popular in electronics and microwave systems \rc{XX-cite}.
We may describe the system with a two-port impedance model, relating the effort ($e_i$) and flow ($q_i$) at each port (see \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_general_two_port_network}).
The products of the effort and flow variables on each port is power.
Note also the sign conventions illustrated in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_general_two_port_network}, which result in a convention of power flow into the two-port network from both sides equal zero and the two-port network is lossless. 

\begin{figure}[tb]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{wec_as_multiport_general_two_port_network.pdf}
        \caption{General two-port network definition showing effort ($e_i$) and flow ($q_i$) at each port.}
        \label{fig:wec_as_multiport_general_two_port_network}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Z_mat_def_general}
        \begin{bmatrix} e_1 \\ e_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Z_{11} & Z_{12} \\ Z_{21} & Z_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} q_1 \\ q_2 \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}

\noindent{}The elements of any two-port impedance matrix may be defined as follows \cite{Frickey:1994aa}.

\begin{subequations} \label{eq:Z_mat_elements_def}
        \begin{align}
                Z_{11}& = \frac{e_1}{q_1} \bigg \vert_{q_2=0} \label{eq:Z_mat_elements_def_Z11} \\[1em]
                Z_{12}& = \frac{e_1}{q_2} \bigg \vert_{q_1=0} \label{eq:Z_mat_elements_def_Z12} \\[1em]
                Z_{21}& = \frac{e_2}{q_1} \bigg \vert_{q_2=0} \label{eq:Z_mat_elements_def_Z21} \\[1em]
                Z_{22}& = \frac{e_2}{q_2} \bigg \vert_{q_1=0} \label{eq:Z_mat_elements_def_Z22}
        \end{align}
\end{subequations}

In addition to the ``impedance form'' shown in \eqref{eq:Z_mat_def_general}, there are many equivalent formulations for modeling two-port networks \cite{Frickey:1994aa}.
Specific formulations can be easier to work with depending on the task at hand.
In this paper, we will also utilize the ``$ABCD$ form'' (also sometimes referred to as chain, cascade, or transmission form):

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:abcd_mat_def_general}
        \begin{bmatrix} e_1 \\ q_1 \end{bmatrix}
        = 
        \begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix} e_2 \\ - q_2 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Similarly to \eqref{eq:Z_mat_elements_def}, the elements of the $ABCD$ matrix are defined as follows.

\begin{subequations} \label{eq:abcd_mat_elements_def}
        \begin{align}
                A = \frac{e_1}{e_2} \bigg \vert_{q_2=0} \label{eq:abcd_mat_elements_def_a} \\[1em]
                B = - \frac{e_1}{q_2} \bigg \vert_{e_2=0} \label{eq:abcd_mat_elements_def_b} \\[1em]
                C = \frac{q_1}{e_2} \bigg \vert_{q_2=0} \label{eq:abcd_mat_elements_def_c} \\[1em]
                D = - \frac{q_1}{q_2} \bigg \vert_{e_2=0} \label{eq:abcd_mat_elements_def_d}
        \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}Note that the impedance form and $ABCD$ form matrix elements are explicitly interrelated (see, e.g., \cite{Frickey:1994aa}).
For example, we may relate the impedance matrix and $ABCD$ as

\begin{equation}
        \begin{bmatrix}
                Z_{11} & Z_{12} \\ Z_{21} & Z_{22}
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \frac{1}{C}
        \begin{bmatrix}
                A & \Delta\left[ ABCD \right] \\ 1 & D
        \end{bmatrix} ,
\label{eq:abcd_to_Z}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}where $\Delta\left[ ABCD \right]$ is the determinant of the $ABCD$ matrix.
From \eqref{eq:abcd_to_Z}, we can see that some representations may be undefined for certain two-port elements (e.g., if $C=0$ in the $ABCD$ form, the impedance form will be undefined).

An important property of a two-port element is that it can be collapsed to a one-port element if one of the ports is terminated with a load and has no independent sources.
Whereas the general two-port element has four variables, two of which are independent, in the scenario where one port of terminated with a load, the system losses a degree of freedom.
Thus, in this case, we may simplify the system as a one-port element (i.e., a single impedance).

Transformers and gyrators (see \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_transformer_gyrator}) are two fundamental classes of two-port networks worthy of further discussion.

\begin{figure}[tb]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{wec_as_multiport_transformer_gyrator.pdf}
        \caption{Transformer and gyrator diagrams and mathematics.}
        \label{fig:wec_as_multiport_transformer_gyrator}
\end{figure}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Transformers}\label{sec:trasnformers}
Electric transformers are widely known and understood to convert between different voltage levels.
For an ideal transformer, we may define a constant $\gamma_{t}$ that relates the effort and flow variables as follows.

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
               e_1 = \gamma_{t} e_2 \\
               q_1 = -\frac{1}{\gamma_t} q_2
        \end{align}
        \label{eq:transformer_eom}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}Note that, as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_transformer_gyrator}, \eqref{eq:transformer_eom} relates the flow at port 1 to the flow at port 2 and effort at port 1 to the effort at port 2 (i.e., the flows are directly related to each other and efforts are directly related to each other).

In an electric transformer, the constant $\gamma_t$ is the ratio of windings on its primary and secondary sides ($\gamma_t=N_p/N_s$).
A geared transmission is a mechanical example of a transformer (see \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_transformer_gyrator}); in this case $\gamma_{t}$ is the gear ratio.
Thus, in $ABCD$ form, we may represent a transformer as

\begin{equation}
        \begin{bmatrix}
                e_1 \\ q_1
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
                \gamma_{t} & 0 \\ 0 & 1/\gamma_{t}
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
                e_2 \\ - q_2
        \end{bmatrix} .
        \label{eq:transformer_abcd}
\end{equation}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Gyrators}\label{sec:gyrators}
Gyrators are effectively the opposites of transformers in that they relate the flow at one port to the effort at the other port.
In general, we may write

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
               e_1 = - \gamma_g q_2 \\
               q_1 = \frac{1}{\gamma_g} e_2 ,
        \end{align}
        \label{eq:gyrator_eom}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}where $\gamma_g$ is gyration modulus.
In $ABCD$ form, the two-port system can be represented as

\begin{equation}
        \begin{bmatrix}
                e_1 \\ q_1
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
                0 & \gamma_g \\ 1/\gamma_g & 0
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
                e_2 \\ - q_2
        \end{bmatrix} .
        \label{eq:transformer_abcd}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}A electric motor/generator is a very relevant example of a gyrator.
In that case, the gyration modulus is the motor constant ($\gamma_g=k_\tau$).
\rc{XX-explain arrow convention for gyrators}.

Note that a cascade of two gyrators has the composite effect of a transformer.
For example, two lossless electric motor/generators with coupled shafts would be equivalent to an electrical transformer with a winding ratio of $\gamma_t=N_p/N_s=\gamma_{g1}/\gamma_{g2}$.
Similarly, coupling two lossless electric motor/generators electrically coupled would be equivalent to a mechanical transmission with a gear ratio of \rc{XX\dots{}}.

\section{Modeling a direct drive WEC}\label{sec:modeling_a_direct_drive_wec}
Using the general definitions for network diagram modeling presented in Section~\ref{sec:two_port_networks}, we now wish to model a WEC.
To this end, let us consider the heaving buoy style ``WaveBot'' device with a direct drive PTO as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_phyiscal_diagram}.
Table~\ref{tab:wec_phyiscal_params} lists key parameters for the WaveBot.
We will first present the WEC and its governing equations in further detail (Section~\ref{sec:dynamic_and_kinematic_equations}) and then represent system via network diagrams using one- and two-port network elements (Section~\ref{sec:modeling_with_a_network_diagram}).

\subsection{Dynamic and kinematic equations}\label{sec:dynamic_and_kinematic_equations}
Vertical motion of the buoy can be expressed as a dynamic equation dependent on the PTO force ($F_{\textrm{pto}}$)\footnote{Note that we define the ``PTO'' force in the opposite direction of the excitation force and velocity as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_phyiscal_diagram}. This sign convention, where, as in \eqref{eq:eom_rectilinear_motion}, we have an expression of the form $Z q = F_1 - F_2$, is most common in network diagrams and control engineering and therefore used herein.}, the excitation force ($F_{\textrm{exc}}$), and the intrinsic impedance ($Z_i$) \cite{Falnes:2002aa}.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{gather}
        F_{\textrm{exc}} - F_{\textrm{pto}} = Z_i v \label{eq:eom_rectilinear_motion} \\
        Z_i(\omega) = B(\omega) + b_f + j \left( \omega \left( m + A(\omega) \right) - \frac{k_{h}}{\omega}\right)
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}\noindent{}Here, $A(\omega)$ is the added mass, $B(\omega)$ is the radiation damping, $k_h$ is the hydrostatic stiffness, $b_f$ accounts for linear friction effects, and $m$ is the rigid body inertia.
The imaginary unit is $j$ and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.
A block diagram\footnote{\label{fn:block_diagrams}Note that block diagrams are related by distinct from the network diagrams used elsewhere in this paper. To emphasize this distinction, a grey fill is used for blocks in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_block_diagram}.} in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_block_diagram} shows the system described by \eqref{eq:eom_rectilinear_motion}.
In \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_block_diagram}, the PTO force is determined based on some mechanical load impedance ($Z_{\ell m}$) -- the details of this will be discussed in more detail later on.
The excitation force ($F_{\textrm{exc}}$) is determined from the excitation transfer function ($H_{\textrm{exc}}$) based on the wave elevation~($\eta$).

\begin{figure}[tb]

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{wec_as_multiport_block_diagram.pdf}
        \caption{Generic block diagram for a wave energy converter. XX THIS IS WRONG SHOULD BE 1/Zi}
        \label{fig:wec_as_multiport_block_diagram}
\end{figure}

The rectilinear vertical velocity ($v$) and force ($F_{\textrm{pto}}$) in \eqref{eq:eom_rectilinear_motion} are transformed into rotational velocity ($v_s$) and torque ($\tau_{\textrm{pto}}$) on a rotating shaft by a ``rack and pinion'' style mechanism with radius $r$.

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{gather}
                N = r \\
                v_s = N v \\
                \tau_{\textrm{pto}} = \frac{1}{N} F_{\textrm{pto}}
        \end{gather}
        \label{eq:rack_and_pinion_transmission}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}Comparing \eqref{eq:rack_and_pinion_transmission} and \eqref{eq:transformer_eom}, we may note that the rack and pinion is an example of a transformer.

The rotating drive train shaft has a characteristic linear friction ($b_d$), inertia ($J_d$), and a may include some non-zero spring stiffness effect against ground ($k_d$).
The opposite end of the drive train shaft interfaces with an electric motor/generator that produces an electromagnetic torque ($\tau_e$).
Thus, we may describe the drive train dynamics as follows.

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{gather}
                \tau_{\textrm{pto}} - \tau_e = Z_d v_s \\
                % Z_d = i \omega J_d + b_d + \frac{k_d}{i \omega}
                Z_d = b_d + j \left( \omega J_d - \frac{k_d}{\omega} \right)
        \end{gather}
\end{subequations}

The electric motor/generator can be considered to have the composite characteristics of a pure gyrator and an impedance.
For the gyrator element, the machine has characteristic torque constant (gyration modulus) $k_\tau$ that relates back EMF voltage ($\forall_{\textrm{emf}}$) to shaft speed and electromagnetic torque to current ($I_{\textrm{out}}$).

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{gather}
                v_s = \frac{1}{k_\tau}\forall_{\textrm{emf}} \\
                \tau_e = k_\tau I_{\textrm{out}}
        \end{gather}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}In addition to its gyration effect, the motor has a characteristic impedance ($Z_w$) that captures the effects of winding resistance ($R_w$) and inductance ($L_w$), and relates the output current to the back EMF voltage ($\forall_{\textrm{emf}}$) and output voltage ($\forall_{\textrm{out}}$).  \rc{-XX reference figure 6b?}

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{gather}
                \forall_{\textrm{emf}} - \forall_{\textrm{out}} = Z_w I_{\textrm{out}}\\
                Z_w = R_w + j \omega L_w \label{eq:winding_impedance}
        \end{gather}
\end{subequations}

Finally, we may define a load impedance ($Z_\ell$) that represents how current is controlled by the motor controller.
\rc{XX-why negative?}


\begin{equation}
        Z_\ell = \frac{\forall_{\textrm{out}}}{I_{\textrm{out}}}
        \label{eq:load_impedance}

\subsection{Modeling with a network diagram}\label{sec:modeling_with_a_network_diagram}

The WaveBot device shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_phyiscal_diagram} and described in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic_and_kinematic_equations} can be represented with network diagrams as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}.
Various levels of abstraction and detail can be achieved in this style of diagram.
\figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}a shows highest level of detail, whereas \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}b and \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}c increasingly combine elements to achieve a single two-port network to represent the PTO.
We will return to \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}d-f for later discussion.

\begin{figure}[tb]

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{PTO impedance matrix}\label{sec:pto_impedance_matrix}

For the network shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}c, we may write an impedance matrix to describe the two-port element representing the PTO.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:Z_mat_def}
        \begin{bmatrix} 
                F_{\textrm{pto}} \\
                \forall_{\textrm{out}} 
        \end{bmatrix} 
        = 
        \begin{bmatrix} 
                Z_{11} & Z_{12} \\ 
                Z_{21} & Z_{22} 
        \end{bmatrix} 
        \begin{bmatrix} 
                v \\
                I_{\textrm{out}} 
        \end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation}

Utilizing \eqref{eq:Z_mat_elements_def} and the equations for our system of interest presented in Section~\ref{sec:dynamic_and_kinematic_equations}, the elements of the impedance matrix in \eqref{eq:Z_mat_def} may be written out as follows.

\clearpage

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
                &Z_{11} = \frac{e_1}{q_1} \bigg \vert_{q_2=0} 
                = \frac{F_{\textrm{pto}}}{v} \bigg \vert_{I_{\textrm{out}}=0} = Z_d \, N^2 \\[0.5em]
                %
                &Z_{12} = \frac{e_1}{q_2} \bigg \vert_{q_1=0} 
                = \frac{F_{\textrm{pto}}}{I_{\textrm{out}}} \bigg \vert_{v=0} = k_\tau \, N \\[0.5em]
                %
                &Z_{21} = \frac{e_2}{q_1} \bigg \vert_{q_2=0} 
                = \frac{\forall_{\textrm{out}}}{v} \bigg \vert_{I_{\textrm{out}}=0} = k_\tau \, N \\[0.5em]
                %
                &Z_{22} = \frac{e_2}{q_2} \bigg \vert_{q_1=0} 
                = \frac{\forall_{\textrm{out}}}{I_{\textrm{out}}} \bigg \vert_{v=0} = -Z_w 
        \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}Taken together, this gives 

 \begin{equation}
        Z_{\textrm{pto}} 
        = 
        \begin{bmatrix} 
                Z_{11} & Z_{12} \\ 
                Z_{21} & Z_{22} 
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix} 
        Z_d \, N^2			& k_\tau \, N  \\
        k_\tau \, N          	& -Z_w
        \end{bmatrix}.
        \label{eq:pto_impedance}
 \end{equation}

 \noindent{}Note that \eqref{eq:pto_impedance} may also be arrived to by cascading the the one- and two-port elements shown in the more detailed diagram in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}a and \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}b. \rc{-XX pretty sure this is a sign error and should be negative Zw}


% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{PTO input and output impedances}\label{sec:pto_input_and_output_impedances}

As noted in Section~\ref{sec:two_port_networks}, two-port networks may be collapsed to a one-port element if one of the ports is terminated with a load and has no independent sources.
The ``output impedance'' of the PTO ($Z_{\textrm{out}}$) is the impedance as seen by a source connected to the output port of PTO element (see \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}d).
As noted, we consider a scenario with no independent sources (i.e., $F_{\textrm{exc}} = 0$) and express the impedance as the ratio of effort to flow variables at the output port.

\begin{equation}
        Z_{\textrm{out}} = \frac{\forall_{\textrm{out}}}{I_{\textrm{out}}} \bigg\vert_{F_{\textrm{exc}}=0}
        \label{eq:Zout_1}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Recalling \eqref{eq:eom_rectilinear_motion}, we may rewrite the expression for the first output in \eqref{eq:Z_mat_def} as follows.

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
                F_{\textrm{pto}} = Z_{11} v + Z_{12} I_{\textrm{out}} \label{eq:Zout_Fpto_1} \\[0.5em]
                -v (Z_i + Z_{11}) = Z_{12} I_{\textrm{out}} \label{eq:Zout_Fpto_2} \\[0.5em]
                \frac{v}{I_{\textrm{out}}} = -\frac{Z_{12}}{Z_i + Z_{11}} \label{eq:Zout_Fpto_3}
        \end{align}
        \label{eq:Zout_Fpto}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}Similarly, the expression for the second output of \eqref{eq:Z_mat_def} may be rearranged as



\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
                \forall_{\textrm{out}} = Z_{21} v + Z_{22} I_{\textrm{out}} \label{eq:Zout_Vout_1} \\[0.5em]
                \frac{\forall_{\textrm{out}}}{I_{\textrm{out}}} = Z_{21} \frac{v}{I_{\textrm{out}}} + Z_{22} . \label{eq:Zout_Vout_2}
        \end{align} 
        \label{eq:Zout_Vout}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}Finally, substituting \eqref{eq:Zout_Fpto_3} into \eqref{eq:Zout_Vout_2} gives an expression for the PTO output port impedance.

\begin{equation}
        Z_{\textrm{out}} = \frac{\forall_{\textrm{out}}}{I_{\textrm{out}}} \bigg\vert_{F_{\textrm{exc}}=0} = Z_{22} - \frac{Z_{12} Z_{21}}{Z_{i} + Z_{11}}
        \label{eq:pto_output_port_impedance}
\end{equation}

The PTO input port's impedance (illustrated in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}e) can be expressed as the ratio of effort ($F_{\textrm{pto}}$) and flow ($v$) on the input port.
We evaluate this scenario with input port open and with the output port fully connected such that the load impedance relates the output voltage and current.
Substituting \eqref{eq:load_impedance} into \eqref{eq:Z_mat_def} in a manner similar as was done for the output port impedance, we find

\begin{equation}
        Z_{\textrm{in}} = \frac{F_{\textrm{pto}}}{v}=  Z_{11} + \frac{Z_{12} \, Z_{21}}{Z_\ell - Z_{22}} .
        \label{eq:pto_input_port_impedance}
\end{equation}

As shown in  \cite{Bacelli:2021aa}, to maximize power transferred to the load, we can apply impedance matching at the input and output ports of the PTO.

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        Z_{\textrm{in}} = Z_i^*  \label{eq:bi_conj_matching_in} \\ 
        Z_{\textrm{out}} = Z_\ell^* \label{eq:bi_conj_matching_out}
    \end{align}
\label{eq:bi_conj_matching}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}Utilizing \eqref{eq:pto_impedance}, the expressions for $Z_{\textrm{in}}$ and $Z_{\textrm{out}}$ may be expanded, giving us some insight into the design implications of the bi-conjugate impedance matching condition specified by \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
        \begin{split}
                Z_{\textrm{out}} &= Z_{22} - \frac{Z_{12} Z_{12}}{Z_{i} + Z_{11}} \\[0.5em]
                &= - Z_w - \frac{k_\tau^2 N^2}{Z_i + Z_d N^2}
        \end{split}\label{eq:expanded_zin} \\[1em]
        \begin{split}
                Z_{\textrm{in}} &= Z_{11} + \frac{Z_{12} \, Z_{21}}{Z_\ell - Z_{22}} \\[0.5em]
                &= Z_d N^2 + \frac{k_\tau^2 N^2}{Z_\ell + Z_w}
        \end{split}\label{eq:expanded_zout}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Power at the load}\label{sec:power_at_the_load}
The complex power at the load is half the product of the effort ($\forall_{\textrm{out}}$) and complex conjugate flow ($I_{\textrm{out}}^*$) at the load \rc{XX-explain why complex conjugate of flow}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
        \mathcal{S}_{\ell} 
        &= \frac{1}{2} \forall_{\textrm{out}} I_{\textrm{out}}^* \\
        &= \frac{1}{2} Z_\ell I_{\textrm{out}} I_{\textrm{out}}^* \\
        &= \frac{1}{2} Z_\ell | I_{\textrm{out}} |^2 \\
        &= \frac{1}{2} Z_\ell \left| \frac{F_{\textrm{exc}} Z_{21}}{ ( Z_{22} + Z_\ell ) (Z_i + Z_{11}) - Z_{21} Z_{12}  } \right|^2 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}We may write active, reactive, and apparent power at the load as.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
&\textrm{Active: } \mathcal{P}_{\ell} = \Re \left\{ \mathcal{S}_{\ell} \right\} \\[0.5em]
&\textrm{Reactive: } \mathcal{Q}_{\ell} = \Im \left\{ \mathcal{S}_{\ell} \right\} \\[0.5em]
&\textrm{Apparent: } | \mathcal{S}_{\ell} |
\end{align}
\label{eq:load_power_types}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}The active power is power dissipated at the load.
Returning to \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_phyiscal_diagram}, note that we have defined this load as the leads between the motor/generator and the motor controller.
Thus, as defined, the activate power represents power into \rc{(XX-into implies positive:good)} the motor controller.
Note that there are additional losses and dynamics in the motor controller before power is delivered to the DC bus.
However, the motor controller dynamics occur at much higher frequencies than those in the rest of the system.
For this reason, we may consider those losses separately and treat the motor controller as a static system (e.g., representing losses in the motor controller as a static function of motor torque and speed).

The transducer gain is the ratio of power delivered to the load to the power available at the source (i.e., the ``wave-to-wire efficiency''). The power by a wave providing excitation force $F_{exc}$ \cite{Falnes:2002aa} is

\begin{equation}
	XX move 36 here
\end{equation}

\noindent{} and thus the wave to wire efficiency can be expressed

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
        G_T &= \frac{\mathcal{P}_{\ell}}{\mathcal{P}_{i}} \\
        &= \frac{4 \left| Z_{21} \right|^2 \Re \left\{ Z_\ell \right\} \Re \left\{ Z_i \right\} }
        {\left| (Z_{11} + Z_i)(Z_{22} + Z_\ell) - Z_{12} Z_{21} \right|^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\ak{Let $P_{\textrm{AVS}}$ be the power avaible at the source, $P_{\textrm{AVN}}$ be the power available at the output of the network, $P_{\textrm{in}}$ be the power delivered to the input port of the network, and $P_\ell$ be the power delivered to the load.
$P_{\textrm{AVS}}$ is defined when $Z_{\textrm{in}} = Z_i^*$ and $P_{\textrm{AVN}}$ is defined when $Z_{\ell} = Z_{\textrm{out}}^*$ , }such that
\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
                P_{\textrm{AVS}} &= \frac{1}{8} \frac{F_{\textrm{exc}}^2}{\Re \left\{ Z_i \right\}} \\
                P_{\textrm{AVN}} &= \frac{1}{8} \frac{F_{\textrm{th}}^2}{\Re \left\{ Z_{\textrm{out}} \right\}} \\
                P_{\textrm{in}} &= \frac{1}{2} v^2 \Re \left\{ Z_{\textrm{in}} \right\}\\
                P_\ell &= \frac{1}{2} I_{\textrm{out}}^2 \Re \left\{ Z_{\ell} \right\}
        \end{align}
\end{subequations}
We shall next define $G_T$ as the transducer power gain, $G_A$ as the available power gain, and $G_O$ as the operating power gain, such that
\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
                G_T &= \frac{P_\ell}{P_{\textrm{AVS}}}  = 4\left(\frac{I_{\textrm{out}}}{F_{\textrm{exc}}}\right)^2\Re \left\{ Z_i \right\}\Re \left\{ Z_{\ell} \right\} \\
                &= 4\left(\frac{Z_{21}}{(Z_{\ell} - Z_{22})(Z_i + Z_{11}) + Z_{12}Z_{21}}\right)^2\Re \left\{ Z_i \right\}\Re \left\{ Z_{\ell} \right\}
        \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
                G_A &= \frac{P_{\textrm{AVN}}}{P_{\textrm{AVS}}}  = \left(\frac{F_{\textrm{th}}}{F_{\textrm{exc}}}\right)^2\frac{\Re \left\{ Z_i \right\}}{\Re \left\{ Z_{\textrm{th}} \right\}} \\
                &= \left(\frac{Z_{21}}{Z_i + Z_{11}}\right)^2\frac{\Re \left\{ Z_i \right\}}{\Re \left\{ Z_{\textrm{th}} \right\}} 
        \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
                G_O &= \frac{P_\ell}{P_{\textrm{in}}}  = \left(\frac{I_{\textrm{out}}}{v}\right)^2\frac{\Re \left\{ Z_{\ell} \right\}}{\Re \left\{ Z_{\textrm{in}} \right\}} \\
                &=  \left(\frac{Z_{21}}{Z_{\ell} - Z_{22}}\right)^2\frac{\Re \left\{ Z_{\ell} \right\}}{\Re \left\{ Z_{\textrm{in}} \right\}} 
        \end{align}
\end{subequations}




\rc{-XX no equation $P_i$ yet: probably better to present this first before obfuscating in the ratio}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Th\'{e}venin equivalent system}\label{sec:thevenin_equivalent_system}
\ak{To design optimal load in order to maximize the power flow from the source to the load, we can simplify the upstream components using Thevenin's theorem. 
The theorem states that a complex electrical network can be replaced by an equivalent circuit, known as the Thevenin equivalent circuit, which consists of a single voltage source in series with a single impedance. 
Using \eqref{eq:eom_rectilinear_motion} and the equation of the two-port network \eqref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}, the following follows:}
\begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
                F_{\textrm{exc}} &= Z_i v + Z_{11} v + Z_{12}I_{\textrm{out}} \\
                v &= \frac{F_{\textrm{exc}} - Z_{12}I_{\textrm{out}} }{Z_i + Z_{11}} \\
                \forall_{\textrm{out}}  &= Z_{21}\frac{F_{\textrm{exc}} - Z_{12}I_{\textrm{out}} }{Z_i + Z_{11}} + Z_{22}I_{\textrm{out}} \\
                &= \frac{Z_{21}}{Z_i + Z_{11}} F_\textrm{exc} + \left(Z_{22} - \frac{Z_{12}Z_{21}}{Z_i + Z_{11}}\right) I_{\textrm{out}} \\
                &= F_{\textrm{th}} + Z_{\textrm{th}}I_{\textrm{out}}
        \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\ak{Using maximum power transfer theorem from circuit theory and the load impedance defined in \eqref{eq:load_impedance}, maximum power transfer occurs when $ Z_\ell = Z_{\textrm{th}}^*$ }

The Th\'{e}venin's theorem \cite{Thevenin:1883aa} states that any one-port network may be described by a single source ($F_{\textrm{th}}$) and impedance ($Z_{\textrm{th}}$) as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}e.
The Th\'{e}venin equivalent networks for WECs have been considered by a number of authors \cite{Bacelli:2021aa,Blanco:2019aa,Bubbar:2018aa,Lewis:2013aa}.
Reviewing \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}e and our previous discussion about collapsing two-port elements to impedances, it becomes clear that the Th\'{e}venin equivalent impedance is equal to the PTO output impedance ($Z_{\textrm{th}} = Z_{\textrm{out}}$).
Similarly, the equivalent source can be determined by considering an effort between points 3 and 4 in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits} when that part of the circuit is open (i.e., no connection between points C and D) such that flow through those points is zero ($I_{\textrm{out}}=0$).

\begin{subequations}
\begin{gather}
        Z_{\textrm{th}} = Z_{\textrm{out}} = Z_{22} - \frac{Z_{21} Z_{12}}{Z_{i} + Z_{11}} \label{eq:Thevenin_impedance} \\[0.5em]
        F_{\textrm{th}} = \frac{F_{\textrm{exc}} Z_{21}}{Z_i + Z_{11}} \label{eq:Thevenin_force}
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}

Note that we may consider the well-known impedance matching condition for the Th\'{e}venin equivalent system.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
        Z_\ell &= Z_{\textrm{th}}^* \\
        &= Z_{\textrm{out}}^* \label{eq:impedance_matching_thevenin_2}
\end{align} \label{eq:impedance_matching_thevenin}
\end{subequations}

\noindent{}Here, in \eqref{eq:impedance_matching_thevenin_2}, we have restated \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching_out}.
Thus, these two modes of representing the system are indeed equivalent and give the same condition for maximum power transfer.
The Th\'{e}venin equivalent system gives a clear expression for the maximum power delivered to the load.

\begin{equation}
        \mathcal{P}_{\ell\textrm{,max}} = \frac{| F_{\textrm{th}} |^2 }{ 8 \Re \left\{ Z_{\textrm{th}} \right\} }
        = \left| \frac{ Z_{21} }{ Z_i + Z_{11} } \right| ^2 \frac{ | F_{\textrm{exc}} |^2 }{ 8 \Re \left\{ Z_{\textrm{th}} \right\} } \label{eq:max_power_delivered_thevenin}
\end{equation}

As illustrated in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}, we may represent the WEC system in many different ways (\figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}a, b, c, and f are all equivalent).
These different representations have different utilities.
The Th\'{e}venin equivalent system in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}f is the most simplified system and gives a clear condition for control design in \eqref{eq:impedance_matching_thevenin} and a limit for maximum power delivered to the load in \eqref{eq:max_power_delivered_thevenin}.
The single two-port representation of the PTO used in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}c provides an additional impedance matching condition in \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching}, thus more clearly expressing the co-design problem.
\figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}b provides further detail by splitting the PTO into separate drive-train and electric machine two-port elements.
While not explored in this paper, a three-part impedance matching condition could be written for the representation shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}b.
\rc{XX-do we indeed have another matching condition if using \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_circuits}b? This can't logically mean that maximum power to load is $(1/2)^n$, where $n$ is the number of two-port elements}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Illustrative examples}\label{sec:illustrative_examples}
Many problems in WEC design can be considered through the concepts discussed in Section~\ref{sec:modeling_a_direct_drive_wec}.
We will consider a subset of these applications in the subsequent sections.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Control design}\label{sec:control_design}
One very relevant and illustrative case is a scenario in which the machine design is considered fixed and we must maximize performance by setting the load impedance (i.e., by designing a controller).
Many papers in the area of WEC control have focused on this very problem.
In most cases, those papers consider mechanical power ($\mathcal{S}_{m}$) as the overall problem objective.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
        \mathcal{S}_{m} 
        &= \frac{1}{2} F_{\textrm{pto}} v^* \\
        &= \frac{1}{2}Z_{\ell m} v v^* \\
        &= \frac{1}{2}Z_{\ell m} | v |^2 \\
        &= \frac{1}{2} Z_{\ell m} \left| \frac{F_{\textrm{exc}}}{Z_i + Z_{\ell m}} \right|^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Here, we define the \emph{mechanical} load impedance as

\begin{equation}
        Z_{\ell m} = \frac{F_{\textrm{pto}}}{v} .
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Returning to \eqref{eq:pto_input_port_impedance}, we see that $Z_{\ell m}=Z_{\textrm{in}}$, thus allowing us to relate $Z_{\ell m}$ and $Z_{\ell}$.

\begin{subequations}
        \begin{gather}
                Z_{\ell m} =Z_{\textrm{in}} = Z_{11} - \frac{Z_{12} \, Z_{21}}{Z_{22} + Z_\ell} \\
                Z_\ell = \frac{Z_{12} \,Z_{21} }{Z_{11} -Z_{\ell m}}-Z_{22}
        \end{gather}
        \label{eq:Zl_Zlm}
\end{subequations}

Reflections up to the input of the PTO may be minimized by satisfy a single conjugate impedance matching condition.

\begin{equation}
        Z_i^* = Z_{\ell m}
        \label{eq:mech_power_impedance_matching}
\end{equation}

\noindent{}Not surprisingly, we see that \eqref{eq:mech_power_impedance_matching} is not dependent on the PTO impedance (i.e., this definition decouples the PTO from the control design problem).

With this in mind, it is instructive to examine the difference between controllers designed to maximize mechanical and electrical power.
\figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_load_impedance_for_mech_power} shows the resulting load impedances for two cases:

\begin{itemize}
        \item the controller to maximize mechanical power: $Z_\ell \vert_{Z_{\ell m} = Z_i^*}$
        \item the controller to maximize electrical power: $Z_\ell = Z_{\mathrm{out}}^*$
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[tb]

        \caption{Load impedances (top and middle axes) created by a controller designed to maximize mechanical power ($Z_\ell \vert_{Z_{\ell m} = Z_i^*}$) and a controller designed to maximize electrical power ($Z_\ell = Z_{\mathrm{out}}^*$) along with the transducer gains (bottom axes) for each controller.}
        \label{fig:wec_as_multiport_load_impedance_for_mech_power}
\end{figure}

\noindent{}From \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_load_impedance_for_mech_power}, we can see that the mechanical power maximizing controller looks notably different from the controller that maximizes electrical power.
At the hydrodynamic resonance ($\sim 0.65$\,Hz), both controllers have zero phase, but the magnitudes do not match.
\rc{XX-shouldn't the electrical maximizing controller have zero phase at another frequency?}
Away from resonance, the phase of the two controllers differ dramatically.
Furthermore, the transducer gain of the two systems are dramatically different, with the gain for the mechanical power maximizing controller \emph{negative} for much of the frequency range -- this means the controller designed to \emph{maximize} mechanical power actually \emph{consumes} electrical power.

The power produced by these controllers is shown in Table~\ref{tab:mech_controller_vs_elec_controller_power}.

\subsection{PTO co-design}\label{sec:pto_codesign}
From \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching}, we can see clear guidance for how the machine and controller can be designed to maximize power delivered to the load (i.e., maximize electrical power output).
Consider, for example, \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances}, where we separately investigate the effects of adding a negative stiffness element\footnote{The addition of a negative stiffness has been applied by CorPower in the form a hydraulic assembly \cite{Todalshaug:2016aa} and also by Sandia Labs via a tunable magnetic spring \cite{Forbush:2024aa}.} to the drive train (\figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances_spring}) and adding inertia to the drive train (\figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances_inertia}).
The left-hand axes in each figure show $Z_{\textrm{in}}$ (colored curves) along with $Z_i^*$ (black dashed curve), which we are essentially attempting to match by altering the machine design.
The right-hand axes in each figure show $Z_{\textrm{out}}$.
In each case, we enforce \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching_out} such the controller ($Z_\ell$) is set to maximize electrical power.

\begin{figure}

         \label{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances_spring}

     \begin{subfigure}[b]{1\columnwidth}

         \caption{Varying levels of shaft inertia ($I_d$)}
         \label{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances_inertia}
     \end{subfigure}
     \caption{Input port (left) and output port (right) impedances. Upper axes show real part ($\Re \{ Z \}$), lower axes show imaginary part ($\Im \{ Z \}$). Impedance matching condition on the input port per \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching_in} illustrated by black dashed curve. \rc{XX-use arrows instead of legends}}
     \label{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances}
\end{figure}


Both of the consider actions (negative stiffness and increased shaft inertia) have the effect of improving impedance matching on the input port at lower frequencies.
Recall also that the power transported by an ocean wave is inversely proportional to the wave frequency ($J \propto f^{-1}$) such that this improved impedance matching at lower frequencies may be particularly advantageous.
It should be noted that the range of values for $K_d$ and $I_d$ shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances} is somewhat arbitrary and intended only to illustrate trends -- one cannot directly compare the effects of doubling the shaft inertia with doubling the negative spring stiffness in terms of an engineering decision.
With this in mind, we can see that, for this specific example, adding shaft inertia (\figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances_inertia}) appears to adversely affect the shape of the input impedance (both in terms of the real and imaginary parts) by narrowing the bandwidth over which a good matching with the intrinsic impedance is achieved, whereas adding a negative spring (\figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances_inertia}) appears to have the opposite affect, generally increasing the bandwidth over which good matching with the intrinsic impedance occurs.


While based on \eqref{eq:drive_train_impedance} we might expect changes to $K_d$ and $I_d$ to only affect the imaginary part of the impedances, we may see by expanding \eqref{eq:pto_output_port_impedance} and \eqref{eq:pto_input_port_impedance} that these terms do indeed effect the real part of the impedances as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:wec_as_multiport_in_and_out_impedances}.

\noindent{}Note that in \eqref{eq:expanded_zout}, we have left $Z_{\textrm{out}}^*$ unexpanded, but one can see rather clearly see by referencing \eqref{eq:expanded_zin} how the drive train stiffness ($K_d$) and inertia ($I_d$) enter in.

\subsection{Steady input}\label{sec:steady_input}
Much of the theory presented here could be interpreted to indicate that WECs are a special case amongst energy conversion systems when compared with, e.g., wind turbines, which utilize a mostly steady power input.
However, it is actually the opposite: the bi-conjugate impedance matching condition given by \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching} is general and the steady input energy conversion systems are a special case of that general theory.

Assuming a similar PTO architecture, the expressions XX remain the same.
The fundamental difference is that the excitation is steady ($\Im \{ Fe \} = 0$) and has no frequency dependence.

\rc{
XX-show that, for a wind turbine, \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching} reduces to minimizing losses -- actually not sure if this follows from \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching} or not? -- and setting $Z_\ell$ to some real value.
XX-How does reducing the real part of the impedance factor in?}

\begin{equation}
        P_{in} = \frac{ | F_{\textrm{exc}} |^2 }{8 \Re \{ Z_i \}}
\end{equation}

\rc{XX-Perhaps you must also consider how changes in $Z_i$ affect $H$ (and therefore $F_{\textrm{exc}}$)?
XX-The Haskind relations connect the excitation transfer function and radiation damping ($\Re \{ Z_i \}$) \cite[pg. 304]{Newman:1978aa}.
For example, for a symmetric 2D body,}

\begin{equation}
        B_{ii}(\omega) = \frac{| H_{ii} |^2}{2 \rho g v_g} .
\end{equation}

\rc{
\noindent{}Alternatively, Falnes presents \cite[pg. 149]{Falnes:2002aa} the following for an axisymmetric body in heave.}

\begin{equation}
        B_{33}(\omega) = \frac{k}{8J} | F_{e,3} |^2
\end{equation}

\rc{
\noindent{}Therefore, increases in the radiation damping result in quadratic increases in the excitation transfer function.

% \noindent{}Here, $v_s$ is the shaft speed, which is related to the hull velocity $v$ by the gear ratio $N$.
% Similarly, the gear ratio relates the force on the hull from the PTO ($F_{\textrm{pto}}$) to the output torque from the PTO shaft ($\tau_{\textrm{pto}}$).
% This output torque $\tau_{\textrm{pto}}$ is due to the electrical torque produced by the motor/generator ($\tau_e$) and a passive effect described by the drive train impedance ($Z_d$).

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
The interrelated nature of the WEC design process becomes quite clear when viewed as an impedance matching problem.
In practice, the bi-conjugate impedance matching requirement expressed by \eqref{eq:bi_conj_matching} cannot be perfectly satisfied at all frequencies and the cost of improving the matching condition must be balanced with the resulting benefits.
However, we can quite easily restrict our frequency band of interest given then nature of ocean waves \cite{Coe2020a}.
Furthermore, constraints (e.g., maximum torque from a generator or maximum travel of a linear piston) and nonlinear dynamics must be considered.

Given these practical considerations, numerical optimization becomes a useful tool becomes useful in practice.
Nonetheless, the linear modeling approach presented here can provide a useful starting point, in particular XX
% We should also remember that, in practice, we must restrict our focus to a finite bandwidth of interest, both because of the band-limited nature of ocean waves (see, e.g., \cite{Coe2020a}) and because a practical design that balances cost and revenue likely needs to be discerning about the added value of improved performance.
